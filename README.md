Development Agreements:
----------------------

 - strive for only 1 branch: make forks for temp developments
 - when making computer vision, try to make it a re-usable function in the vision lib WITH test function
 - use PR and code review to add code to the release branch (do not push directly to master)
 - docs inline with code (todo: auto-generate)
 - when making project files: explain what they do
